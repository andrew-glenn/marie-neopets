										<h1>Team Scoring Philosophy</h1><br><br>
Here at Terror Mountain, we believe that the only score that doesn't count is the one not sent.<br><br>
The Altador Cup is a unique event.  Although we don't know for certain how the team scoring works, we have tested a few theories and believe it rewards <font class="b">individual players</font> based on the number games played regardless of the scores submitted and rewards the <font class="b">team</font> with higher tournament ranking based on the numbers of games submitted with scores above the minimum requirement.<br><br>
We appreciate and understand that individual gaming abilities and available gaming time varies.  <br><br>
We appreciate and understand players wanting to earn the maximum amount of points for the prize shop and the highest rank possible.  We ask that you consider the overall team success in the tournament and do so responsibly by not sending in minimum scores.<br><br>
In YYB, a minimum of 5 clean goals would be appreciated, but I know you can do better than that! Your goals minus opposing team goals equals clean goals.<br>
In SLS, playing games with a minimum score of 540 (double the regular minimum score) or higher would be awesome!<br>
In MSN, playing games with a minimum score of 3500 - 5000 would be fantastic!<br>
In SOSD, playing games with a minimum score of 600 or higher would be great!<br><br>
Your scores should improve with the number of games you play  to make it easier to reach those levels.<br><br>
Happy gaming team!<br><br><h2>Game Guides</h2><br><br>

Inclusive game guides can be found on the fan sites JellyNeo and SunnyNeo.  Video tutorials can also be found off-site. 
Limited game information for each game is listed below.<br><br>

We recommend you take the opportunity to play the games on all your devices prior to the start of the Tournament.  <br><br>

If you have issues or the games are glitchy or laggy, you can try a different browser. Depending on your system, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc. might work better for you. <br><br><h3>YYB Information</h3><br><br>

In Yooyuball (YYB), the object is to throw the ball into the opposing team's goal. Slings are used to carry and throw the ball, which is a curled-up Petpet called a Yooyu.<br>

Current Maximum games per day: 35<br>

Must be a Win or Draw to count.  Draws are worth half the points of a win, so please try to send wins only.<br><br>


Tips:<br>

Use the Ice Drop Powerup as often as you can to freeze your opponents.<br>
Use the Bigger Goal Powerup as often as you can to make the goal bigger.  This typically last for three goals if you score quickly.<br>
After you score, move your players around the board and try to pick up the powerups you don't like.  For example, I don't like the make you bigger or faster powerups.  <br>
Hopefully, you'll get the powerups you want, like the ice or bigger goal powerups in the next round, because they only drop so many.<br>
Play in low-res by adding &quality=low to the end of your YYB game link.<br>
The ricochet method is to grab the yooyu and move in a diagonal to the bottom wall. You should end up approximately lined up with the first white flag on the top wall. Bounce the yooyu off the wall, and it will go into the top corner of the goal.<br><br><br>
Yooyu-Specific Traits/Tips
<ul><b>Clockwork</b> yooyus have a time limit, then they explode. Take advantage of ice and/or speed powerups to increase your chances of scoring.<br><b>Darigan</b> yooyus are ridiculous.  I have no tips.  You're on your own.<br><b>Faerie</b> yooyus curve gracefully as they fly.  Head straight for the net and release.<br><b>Fire</b> yooyus can only be held a few seconds. Bouncing them off the wall is the easier way to score than shooting directly into the goal.<br><b>Mutant</b> yooyus misbehave often and take on the traits of other YYB's after the first throw or if you hold them too long.  Make your first attempt quickly by pretending they are regular YYB.<br><b>Normal</b> yooyus shoot straight, and are the easiest to score with.<br><b>Snow</b> yooyus, my personal favorite, take their time, are more chill. Use bigger and faster powerups if possible.<br><p>

											<br><br>You can add more links by copying the same scheme as above, or delete those you don't need, and you can rename them, as well. You can also remove the links entirely if you don't want an anchored petpage and put something else here. To add more pages to go with the additional links, just copy the div code for any of the pages from 2-5, starting at the div class="content2", and going to the /div. Very flexible layout. ;) Change anything you like, as long as you leave the following credit link:<br><br><br><br>
